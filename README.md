# Development
D++ and the Cyclone-IDE is created by Alan Sun and Dylan Williams. It is built from scratch completely using Java. Its creation enforces us to go above and beyound our skill level. 

# D++
D++ is a programming language that is designed to be beginner friendly. It has simple syntaxes similar to Python, where each instruction is separated on a different line, using tabs to indicate nesting. Keywords and built in functions in D++ is highly customizable. For example, users can change the keyword 'print' to any string they want, such as 'p' or 'cout'. New programmers can take advantage of this customizability to reduce the complexity of keywords and built in functions for simple I/O programs, while also being able to change the keywords to their other comfort languages. 

# Cyclone-IDE
Cyclone is the IDE for the custom programming language D++. It offers, but not limited to the following UI features: 
* code editor with line numbers
* output console that updates when program is executed
* task bar that contains all the opened files
* menu bar that provides access to different UI commands and setting pannels
* project menu that contains folders and files of a project
* customization pannel that enables users to customize keywords and built in functions
* appearance window that enable users to switch between dark mode and light mode
* help pannel that gives a tour for using the IDE

After a user finishes writing their simple D++ program, the IDE will translate the code into Java and uses the Java Virtual Machine to compile.

# Additional Note
D++ Development Environment is only suiable for Windows devices. The compiler being used does not support MacOS and Linux operating systems.
